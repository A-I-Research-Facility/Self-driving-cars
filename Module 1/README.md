# ðŸ’¢ Module 1 : Requirements for Autonomy

Self driving cars can be considered as rich, inter-disciplinary problems. This module is focused on introducing the language and structure of problem definition, along with most salient elements of driving task and environment.

<br>

This module deals with : 
* Defining necessary environmental elements
* Breakdown of driving tasks into decisions and actions
* Analysis of factors affecting driving task
* Perception, prediction, planning requirements for driving
