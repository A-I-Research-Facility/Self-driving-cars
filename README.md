# Self Driving Cars

Introductory course on self driving cars. This course follows through real world data and scenarios from reasearches conducted by some of leading experts in the industry. 

This is a self sufficient, beginner friendly course that is easy to follow along. However, if you face any queries, please use the discussions tab.

## üìò Chapter 1 : Taxonomy of driving

### üñçÔ∏è Important terms and their definitions :-<br>
1. **Driving task** : This consists of 3 subtasks. They are, 
    * perceiving the environment; 
    * planning route from point A to B; 
    * controlling the vehicle.

2. **Operational design domain (ODD)** : It defines the optimal operating conditions for a system. Like, roads, environment, etc. Needs to be planned carefully in advanced.

### üñçÔ∏è How to classify level of automation in driving systems?<br>

In order to understand this, we need to answer the following questions :
* How much DRIVER ATTENTION is needed?
* How much DRIVER ACTION is needed?
* What makes up a complete driving task?

### üñçÔ∏è How do we define a driving task?<br>

To define a driving task, we need some fundamental properties.
* Firstly, we have `LATERAL control`. In other words, steering and navigation on a road.<br>
* Next, we have `LONGITUDINAL control`. This refers to controlling the position and velocity of car on a road through acceleration or braking actions.<br>
* After this, we have `Object and Event Detection and Response (OEDR)`. This refers to detection and response of objects that immidiately affect the driving task. This is used in conjunction with specific ODD.
* Next, comes `Planning`. This refers to the selection of routes and deciding the lanes and crossings of movement.
* Finally, we have `Miscellaneous` tasks. These consist of actions like signalling using indicators, controlling the lights, etc.

### üñçÔ∏è Which questions will lead us to taxonomy for classifying level of automation?<br>

We have already vaguely answered this. Formally, they are :
* Can system handle lateral control?
* Can system handle longitudinal control?
* Can system handle emergency responses?
* Is driver attention required in emergencies?
* Does the system have a limited ODD, or it can perform in all conditions?

### üñçÔ∏è What are common levels of automation (defined by SAE Standard J3 016)?<br>

* :atom: **Level 0** : No automation
    * Everything done by driver
<br>

* :atom: **Level 1** : Driving assistance
    * Either lateral, or, longitudunal control by system
    * Only one control, not both
    * Examples, 
        1. Adaptive cruise control - controls the speed by acceleration and braking
        2. Lane keeping assistance - controls steering to stop drift
<br>

* :atom: **Level 2** : Partial driving automation
    * Both lateral, and longitudinal control by system
    * Examples,
        1. GM Super cruise
        2. Nissan ProPilot assist
<br>

* :atom: **Level 3** : Conditional driving automation
    * In addition to level 2, system can perform some sort of OEDR
    * Controversial level of automation since it is not really possible for autonomy system to know that it is failing at the moment
    * The driver still needs to be attentive and be ready to take control of the car, however, the system will alert the driver
    * Example, Audi A8 can navigate unmonitored in slow traffic
<br>

* :atom: **Level 4** : High driving automation
    * In this level, the system is capable of reaching a minimum risk condition in case the driver doesn't intervenes in time of emergency.
    * This level of system can handle emergency on its own, but might ask the driver to take over to avoid an uneccassary stop on the road.
    * The driver can check their phones or engage in other activities
    * This level of automation is still only possible in limited ODD
    * Example, vehiclces deployed by Waymo for public transport
<br>

* :atom: **Level 5** : Fully autonomous driving
    * Add unlimited ODD to level 4, and we have the highest level of automation in driving systems

### üñçÔ∏è What are the limitations of this taxonomy?<br>

* Levels of autonomy are a course measure, i.e., 2 different car models claimig the same level can have very different capabilities
* ODD is very important
* Safety of driver, passenger, and everybody and everything else on the road is the most important
